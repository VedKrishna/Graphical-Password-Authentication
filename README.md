# Graphical-Password-Authentication
Graphical Password Authentication is a project which uses images instead of alphanumeric text as password to verify the user at login.

The GPA.py file consists of the required code to add images from local memory to the sql database.
The folders contain an outline of how the images were stored and used during the creation of the project.
